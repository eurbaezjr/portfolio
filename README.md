## Summary

A frontend application that programmatically sorts and gets data from Github's API as work is starred. Application was built using HTML5, ES6, React.js, Axios, Bootstrap, Anime.Js and other react component libraries. Custom algorithm sorts and fetches the data automatically allowing user to browse through my starred repositories with ease.

## Functionality

* About Page: user is greeted with animated components, then work and education experience populates as user scrolls down.

*  Portfolio Page: user is able to sort through content by using the search bar or by clicking the items in the scrollable menu. Then all repositories that match the search will populate instantly. Recruiting managers can then click on any of the result cards to be redirected to the Github repository that holds the source code.
